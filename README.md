# Face-Detection
This is a simple project that uses Python and OpenCV to detect faces in real time using your webcam. I made this project using Anaconda and ran the code in Jupyter Notebook.  When you run the code, it opens your camera, finds faces in the video, and draws green boxes around them.

## Tools Used   
- OpenCV  
- Anaconda  
- Jupyter Notebook
